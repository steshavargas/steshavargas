        <h2>Wares for Sale</h2>
        <br>
        
        <p>Tents were full of peopleâ€™s created wares. Wood carvings and metal work, <br>
        picture prints and paintings. Jewelry, knitted hats, chests and crates - a single gathering of <br>
        homemade artifacts, but on a higher up comparison. And all of it was for sale. </p>

        <p>The atmosphere was very homey - there were lots of families. It was nice too, knowing <br>
        that dogs were allowed. Owners went about with different sizes and breeds while I looked <br>
        around. There was a live musician, playing on a stage with a guitar. It was almost soothing as the <br>
        woman sang and played in front of benches and a few tables.</p>
